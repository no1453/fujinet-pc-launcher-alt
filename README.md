# fujinet-pc-launcher-alt
Launcher and closer for fujinet-pc (https://github.com/a8jan/fujinet-pc)

This short script starts fujinet-pc, netsio-hub, and Altirra.   When Altirra is closed, other processes are closed also.

It requires fujinet-pc to be built under the Windows Subsystem for Linux, and the script also runs in WSL.  To build fujinet-pc under WSL, just follow the Linux instructions.
Once fujinet-pc is set up and working, this script can be used to start it all (after modifying the directories at the top of the script to point to your Altirra and fujinet-pc directories.)
